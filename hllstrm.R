# Check whether the data has been randomly assigned. This is an important assumptions in uplift modeling and, more generally, experimental designs. To verify a random assignment, we have to check the balance of the A/B indicator. The function checkBalance calculates standardized mean differences along each covariate and tests for conditional independence of the treatment variable and the covariates. In randomized empirical experiments the treatment and control groups should be roughly similar (i.e. balanced) in their distributions of covariates.
# Of course, we would expect the conversion rate to be different between the treatment and control group
#library("uplift")
cb <- checkBalance(treatment~.-conversion, data = trainData, report = c("adj.means", "adj.mean.diffs", "p.values", "chisquare.test"))

# Balance properties of first ten covariates 
# Be aware that the results are saved as a tensor or '3D matrix'.
dim(cb$results)
round(cb$results[,,], 2)
# The function automatically computes a chi-squared test for the conditional independence of the covariates to the treatment variable
cb$overall

# The test rejects the null hypothesis that the sample is balanced, i.e. truly randomized, at the 1% level. The reason is possibly that the customer were not assigned randomly to the treatment and control group, but based on some non-random procedure, e.g. an existing model or some decision rule.
# Think deeply about how this will impact your model!
